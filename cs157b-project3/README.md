CS 157B - Project 3

Installation
Create a user library in Eclipse, then import all of the JAR files (from inside the /lib folder) to that library.
Add the JDBC driver to your build path (like with project 2). If your database is running, and it is MySQL, create a new database/schema named cs157b. Then change the user/password inside the configuration file hibernate.cfg.xml.

Run the program. If everything is set up correctly, you should have a new table inside your cs157b database.

If you are not using MySQL, you will have to make substantial changes to the hibernate.cfg.xml file.
